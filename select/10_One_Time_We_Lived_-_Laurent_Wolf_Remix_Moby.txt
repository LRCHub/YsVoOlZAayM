Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we had, do we know what we need now that its gone?

One time we lived
Like the time would never leave
One time we had
The Luxury to breath
We couldn't see an end
There was no end in sight
The time has risen up
Time has pulled us down
Bringing darkness to the light

I remember the way you looked
The sun had set, the lights were down
I remember the light in your eyes

Do you remember at all?
Do you remember at all?

Well,
Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we had, do we know what we need, now that its gone?

Well,
Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we had, do we know what we need?

One time we lived
Like the time would never end
And now it breaks
Both left alone again
While the waters coarse
By the old and pale light
I see just what I've lost
And die into the night

I remember the way you looked
The sun had set, and the lights were down
I remember the light in your eyes

Do you remember at all?
Do you remember at all?

Well,
Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we had, do we know what we need now that its gone?

Well,
Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we had, do we know what we need now that its gone?

Now that its gone...

Now that its gone...

Now That its gone...

Well,
Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we had, do we know what we need now that its gone?

Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we wanted?
Isn't that what we had, do we know what we need now that its gone?

Now that its gone...

Now that its gone...

Now that its gone...
